The `anomalize` package functionality has been superceded by `timetk`. We suggest you begin to use the `timetk::anomalize()` to benefit from enhanced functionality to get improvements going forward. [Learn more about Anomaly Detection with `timetk` here.](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/articles/TK08_Automatic_Anomaly_Detection.html) 

The original `anomalize` package functionality will be maintained for previous code bases that use the legacy functionality. 

To prevent the new `timetk` functionality from conflicting with old `anomalize` code, use these lines:

``` r
library(anomalize)

anomalize <- anomalize::anomalize
plot_anomalies <- anomalize::plot_anomalies
```

> Tidy anomaly detection

`anomalize` enables a tidy workflow for detecting anomalies in data. The main functions are `time_decompose()`, `anomalize()`, and `time_recompose()`. When combined, it's quite simple to decompose time series, detect anomalies, and create bands separating the "normal" data from the anomalous data.

Check out our entire [Software Intro Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk_HwjhlQJs&list=PLo32uKohmrXsYNhpdwr15W143rX6uMAze) on YouTube!

## Installation

You can install the development version with `devtools` or the most recent CRAN version with `install.packages()`:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("business-science/anomalize")
install.packages("anomalize")
```

## How It Works

`anomalize` has three main functions:

- `time_decompose()`: Separates the time series into seasonal, trend, and remainder components
- `anomalize()`: Applies anomaly detection methods to the remainder component.
- `time_recompose()`: Calculates limits that separate the "normal" data from the anomalies!

## Getting Started

Load the `tidyverse` and `anomalize` packages.

```{r, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(anomalize)

# NOTE: timetk now has anomaly detection built in, which 
#  will get the new functionality going forward.
#  Use this script to prevent overwriting legacy anomalize:

anomalize <- anomalize::anomalize
plot_anomalies <- anomalize::plot_anomalies
```


Next, let's get some data.  `anomalize` ships with a data set called `tidyverse_cran_downloads` that contains the daily CRAN download counts for 15 "tidy" packages from 2017-01-01 to 2018-03-01.

Suppose we want to determine which daily download "counts" are anomalous. It's as easy as using the three main functions (`time_decompose()`, `anomalize()`, and `time_recompose()`) along with a visualization function, `plot_anomalies()`.

```{r tidyverse_anoms_1, fig.height=8}
library(magrittr)
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    # Data Manipulation / Anomaly Detection
    time_decompose(count, method = "stl") %>%
    anomalize(remainder, method = "iqr") %>%
    time_recompose() %>%
    # Anomaly Visualization
    plot_anomalies(time_recomposed = TRUE, ncol = 3, alpha_dots = 0.25) +
    ggplot2::labs(title = "Tidyverse Anomalies", subtitle = "STL + IQR Methods") 
```

Check out the [`anomalize` Quick Start Guide](https://business-science.github.io/anomalize/articles/anomalize_quick_start_guide.html). 

## Reducing Forecast Error by 32%

Yes! Anomalize has a new function, `clean_anomalies()`, that can be used to repair time series prior to forecasting. We have a [brand new vignette - Reduce Forecast Error (by 32%) with Cleaned Anomalies](https://business-science.github.io/anomalize/articles/forecasting_with_cleaned_anomalies.html).
```{r}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    dplyr::filter(package == "lubridate") %>%
    dplyr::ungroup() %>%
    time_decompose(count) %>%
    anomalize(remainder) %>%
  
    # New function that cleans & repairs anomalies!
    clean_anomalies() %>%
  
    dplyr::select(date, anomaly, observed, observed_cleaned) %>%
    dplyr::filter(anomaly == "Yes")
```


## But Wait, There's More!

There are a several extra capabilities:

- `plot_anomaly_decomposition()` for visualizing the inner workings of how algorithm detects anomalies in the "remainder". 

```{r, fig.height=7}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    dplyr::filter(package == "lubridate") %>%
    dplyr::ungroup() %>%
    time_decompose(count) %>%
    anomalize(remainder) %>%
    plot_anomaly_decomposition() +
    ggplot2::labs(title = "Decomposition of Anomalized Lubridate Downloads")
```

For more information on the `anomalize` methods and the inner workings, please see ["Anomalize Methods" Vignette](https://business-science.github.io/anomalize/articles/anomalize_methods.html). 

## References

Several other packages were instrumental in developing anomaly detection methods used in `anomalize`:

- Twitter's `AnomalyDetection`, which implements decomposition using median spans and the Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviation (GESD) test for anomalies.
- `forecast::tsoutliers()` function, which implements the IQR method.
